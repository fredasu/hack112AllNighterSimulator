This was created for a school hackathon (hack112) in Spring 2021. Teams were created randomly and everyone was remote.
Thus, it was more practical for only one person to code, while everyone else contributed different aspects (ex: graphics, music, gameplay) of the game.
I was mostly responsible for creating the gameplay design/structure.
